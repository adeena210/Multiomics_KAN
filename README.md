# Multiomics_KAN

## Overview
**Multiomics_KAN** is a bioinformatics project that leverages **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)** to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of **multi-omic data integration**. This project focuses on analyzing **scRNA-seq & scATAC-seq data** from hippocampal cells, enabling a deeper understanding of cellular mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases such as **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease**.
